The essentials you need for your Minecraft server.

This plugin is written from scratch and is rich with features for your Minecraft server.

This project is mainly for me to learn java a bit better while also giving people an alternative to  
the already great EssentialsX plugin.

### This plugin is currently __under construction__
So I don't suggest downloading and building it or adding to your server.  
If the plugin reaches alpha or beta state, **use with caution so your server won't be broken!**

There is also a chance that my code might not look neat enough or have points that doens't follow Java's formatting rules.  
So bare with my code. As long as it works and doesn't cause issues, it's fine.  
Any issues that arise I will fix. Be sure to create a new issue if something is wrong!
