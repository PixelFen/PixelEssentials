# CHANGING THESE MAY REQUIRE A SERVER RESTART!

# Modules are aspects of PixelEssentials you can toggle.
# So if you prefer another economy plugin, or another chat system...
# You can disable those aspects of the plugin here.
#
# This makes it so you just need one plugin and not need to
# install any additional addons.
#
# Available modules:
#  Economy - The currency system of the plugin.
#  better-whitelist - A better whitelist system that supports IP whitelisting.
#  Chat - Chat formatting and channels.
#  Teleportation - Teleportation related things like homes, warp, tpask, etc.
#  Moderation - vanish, invsee, and other moderation related items.
#  Utils - god, gamemode, xp, ping, powertool, nicks, etc.
#  Random - ptime, skull, and other random or fun things.


# Setting any of these values to 'false' will disable them entirely.
# Consider checking their respective configs so you can disable or modify
# them to your liking.
